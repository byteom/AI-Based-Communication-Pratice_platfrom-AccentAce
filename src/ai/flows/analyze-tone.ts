  Analyze the provided audio recording. Evaluate the user's pitch, tone, volume, and pacing to determine how successfully they conveyed the target emotion.

  User's recording: {{media url=recordedAudioDataUri}}
  
  Provide the following analysis:
  - consistencyScore: A score from 0 to 100 representing how well the vocal delivery matched the "{{emotion}}" emotion.
  - pitchAnalysis: Specific feedback on the user's pitch. Was it varied or monotone? Was the intonation appropriate for the emotion?
  - volumeAnalysis: Specific feedback on the user's volume. Was it too loud, too soft, or just right? Was there dynamic variation?
  - overallFeedback: Constructive, actionable advice on how the user could better convey the "{{emotion}}" emotion in their speech.
